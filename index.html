      <h2>I have always hated an unsolved puzzle, something staring me in the face with the colors out of place, or the pieces misaligned. When I was first introduced to computer programming--in processing no less-- it felt like the pieces of a puzzle falling into place. Finally, Now, I get to play with data like I would a rubics cube, shaping and organizing it the way I need. I am privellaged to be able to build the tools that other developers solve need, each one solving a larger puzzle.</h2>

    <!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually
    contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's
    take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to
    this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section.
    Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

      <!--Time to process. How do you use media? What role do certain kinds of media play in your life? How does media serve a social function? In what way might
      you be "recreating" or "remaking" media in your everyday life?

      FUN FACT: "Lorem ipsum", "Lorem ipsum" was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum," developers made it non-sensical. So while you will probably
      never write as well as Cicero, you can always improve upon "Lorem ipsum." -->

      often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and a group of colleagues or friends, you might find community across the frontiers of the dead, and perhaps
      even with those who have never lived. I'll let you explain. -->
